\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to analyze and synthesize all the information about the situation of online learning, in order to generate comprehensive overview of the E-learning drive platform with needs and possible features.  It focuses on the users’ and stakeholders’ needs, the using environments and the reason of those needs. It also provides the proposal of the way that E-learning platform meets these needs.
\bigskip
\subsection{Scope}
This Vision Document applies to the E-Concordia drive system, which will be developed by the development team. This system will allow trainers to upload the lessons to the Internet under supervision, so the students can learn and practice driving lessons online.
